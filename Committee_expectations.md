# Graduate Committees, and the meetings with them.
A graduate committee is your official team of mentors and, effectively, instructors, as you move through your graduate program. These are the people that assess your progress, administer examinations, and ultimately sign the paperwork to award your degree, so chosing people that both have expertise in what you're doing AND you have a good rapport with is important. There's a few rules about grad committees in BSCI programs at Kent State- namely, they must be composed of MAJORITY of members from the BSCI department. PhD committees also must contain at least ONE 'outside dicipline' member. For really interdiciplinary people (like the folks in my lab tend to be!), the challenge is balancing your interdiciplinary advising needs with constraint #1. These 'outside dicipline' people can be from other departments at Kent, other universities, or experts in government or industry that hold PhDs. The catch is we need to appoint them as 'graduate faculty' so there's a bit of paperwork involved if we go farther afield, and other academics tend to be most familiar with the procedures in grad advising.

The first member of your committee is your advisor. If you're reading this, that's probably Christie. This is your on-the-ground mentor- this is typically the person that provides the space and front-line advising. You probably knew this (and her!) going in. Your advisor is the one who is ultimately *responsible* for the administration of your program and the quality of the work you send out into the world while enrolled in the program.

For master's students, you need to have 3 (and rarely, 4) faculty members on your committee. Your advisor is 1, and you need to select at LEAST ONE other member of the BSCI graduate faculty to sit on your committee as the second. Your third member can be from BSCI, or can be an external person.

For doctoral students, your committee starts in basically the same form, with the same constraints, as a master's student, with 3, and rarely four members. After you pass your candidacy exam, you will be required to add one additional member- this is when most students add the external person because the paperwork works out nicer. If we find ourselves with two external members, though, we need Christie plus 2 BSCI faculty, because to the 'majority BSCI' rule, for a total of 5. Don't look at me, I didn't make the forms up.
