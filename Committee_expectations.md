# Graduate Committees, and meetings with them.
A graduate committee is your official team of mentors and, effectively, instructors, as you move through your graduate program. These are the people that assess your progress, administer examinations, and ultimately sign the paperwork to award your degree, so chosing people that both have expertise in what you're doing AND you have a good repport with is important. There's a few rules about grad committees in BSCI programs at kent state- namely, they must be composed of MAJORITY of members from the BSCI department. PhD committees also must contain ONE 'outside dicipline' member. For really interdiciplinary people (like the folks in my lab tend to be!), the challenge is balancing your interdiciplinary advising needs with constraint #1.

The first member of your committe is your advisor. If you're reading this, that's probably Christie. This is your on-the-ground mentor- this is typically the person that provides the space and front-line advising. You probably knew this (and her!) going in.
