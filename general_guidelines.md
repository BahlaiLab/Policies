# General Lab Policies and Guidelines
Welcome to the [Bahlai Lab of Applied Quantitative Ecology](https://bahlailab.org/)! I'm very excited that you're here. In this lab, we study a variety of habitats, taxa and processes, with the core elements of using data, math and computational techniques to gain better understanding of ecological systems. We're committed to applying what we learn to making the world a better place- by supporting sustainability and productivity in working ecosystems, by making the work we do accessible to the broader community, and by drawing in diverse viewpoints to future mutual understanding of science, scientists, and the needs of the world.  
## Open philosophy
First and foremost, the Bahlai Lab is an [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) lab. There are several major facets to this, but the core is: *the way this lab operates is grounded in my personal belief that participation in science is a public act, and in the public good.* Science allows us to be part of something bigger, and to foster a healthy, collaborative and truly inclusive scientific enterprise, it's essential that we give back at least as much as we take from the community. I could get down into the weeds about specific tools and techniques that we use to support our open science infrastructure here, but those are used to support these values, they themselves are not the values. What we commit to do, as open scientists, is:

* Make supporting research data freely available whenever possible, to support future use in meta-analyses, reviews, and revisitations of our work. 

* Respect privacy and confidentiality in cases where data or research products contain sensitive information. Do no harm. 

* Produce and share reproducible, re-usable data manipulation and analysis code, so people can understand our assumptions and workflows, and so future scientists can learn from our efforts without dupicating them.

* Publish final manuscripts AND intermediate research products in the most accessible formats available to us. 

* Seek out expertise from conventional and unconventional stakeholders in our work. Invite comment and participation. Welcome feedback.

* Acknowledge contributions to our work. Provide [territorial acknowledgements](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/territorial-acknowledgements-indigenous-1.4175136) for work involving land use. Cite the ideas of others.

* Act as ambssadors of open science, and science in general, to the broader scientific community and the world. Help people see what we do, but respect the constraints others must work under.
