# Graduate programs

In general, I will take students via Kent's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Graduate program. Typical master's programs are 2-3 years, and typical PhDs will take 5-6 years. In our programs, students typically take 2-3 classes per semester during their first two years of study. Some of these courses will be prescribed by the program, and others will be selected in conjunction with your committee, based on students interests, goals, and project. Each student will complete original resaerch as the core goal of their graduate program. "Research" is dificult to quantify without using the constructs of western (Eurocentric) academic standards, but generally the expectation is that the quantum we use is a "paper" and a MS student will produce 2-3 papers of research and a PhD student will produce 3-5. For our purposes, original scientific software, a lucid database interface, a major extension document might also 'count' for our purposes. I also expect students to complete an extensive literature review of their topic in their first year of study- this will be the underpinning of all your future research: it is essential you know what's been done in thei field previously before you know how you can build on it by addressing your specific problem.
