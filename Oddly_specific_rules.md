# Hmm. 
Here are some oddly specific rules for the Bahlai Lab. 
## Writing and Presentations
- Never, ever use "Size matters:...." in  the title (or anything else) of a presentation/poster/article you write. Not only is it an inappropriate joke about genitalia, which is gross, it represents a _trivial hypothesis_. More treatment = more effect? Don't embarrass us like that. You can do better.
- Significant figures! A mean should never be reported to a greater degree of precision than the first significant figure of its corresponding error. 123.456 +/- 6.789 is lying to make your data look more scientificer. Be honest, and report 123 +/-7, it's less precise but more accurate.
