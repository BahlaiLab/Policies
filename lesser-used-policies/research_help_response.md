I created this boilerplate in response to a large number of interview requests from students who had been assigned an "Interview an Expert" project. I love kids, I love science, but these assignments are really hard on me (and others like me). First, most of the requests are not targetted at my research area, so honestly I'm not much better than a person on the street- but a lot of these queries don't need expertise. Frankly, they need a wikipedia article. Secondly, I take my position as an expert seriously- and because many of these proposed interviews are supposed to be recorded- I don't want to misspeak or make a generalization that goes on the record. Experts speaking on their area of expertise is hard work. Thirdly, while I prioritize some of my time towards public outreach, speaking to lots of people, individually, is not very efficient-and responding to each request would quickly fill my time.

Finally. These requests are really stressful to say no to. This is me being really honest. I've been socialized as a woman and a fat person: the cultural expectations for people like me are to be friendly, compliant, and accomodating. I know if I don't meet that expectation it comes with social costs, and these social costs are greater for me than people who don't have these expectations connecting to their identity. 

Anyway, if you send your students out into the world to interview experts for the sake of interviewing experts, they will get some version the below as a reply. There's some links also below that you may find helpful.

Hi Student!

I’m a biology  and data science professor, so I don’t think I can be much help to you on X, but I can offer you a few general research tips to get started. Generally, it’s not a good idea to reach out to experts until you have specific questions you need them to answer, and you’ll want to read some general references first- I suggest starting with Wikipedia! (I know a lot of teachers like to say Wikipedia isn’t a reliable source, but they’re confused- it’s a secondary source so it’s one removed from the original information, but it’s generally verified better than a lot of sources because people are constantly checking it) and that will let you think about questions and point you to primary sources- these are the places where the information was recorded for the first time. 

Asking professors for help is a great idea, but only once you have specific questions that can't be answered easily online and you can make sure you’re directing your questions to the right people. Generally we put a fair bit about what we do on the web, either through our university or personal websites. You can look at directories (For example [ directory of a department that actually does  X ]) and once you find someone whose expertise/ research area aligns with the question you’re asking- and then reach out to them- you might want to ask them specific questions about their opinions on things relevant to your research topic, but you have to be specific: asking a professor about general information that's available on the web isn't the best use of their (or your!) time.

I understand you're likely reaching out to fulfil the requirements of an assignment- please feel free to share my response with your instructor. Scientists get many requests like this and a lot of us just can't keep up with them, so please share [these](https://smallpondscience.com/2015/04/13/in-which-k-12-teachers-assign-students-to-contact-an-expert/) [links](https://www.astrokatie.com/student-requests) with them to help give context.

Good luck with your project!

Best,
Dr. Bahlai
