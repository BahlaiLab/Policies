Hi Student!

I’m a biology  and data science professor, so I don’t think I can be much help to you on X, but I can offer you a few general research tips to get started. Generally, it’s not a good idea to reach out to experts until you have specific questions you need them to answer, and you’ll want to read some general references first- I suggest starting with Wikipedia! (I know a lot of teachers like to say Wikipedia isn’t a reliable source, but they’re confused- it’s a secondary source so it’s one removed from the original information, but it’s generally verified better than a lot of sources because people are constantly checking it) and that will let you think about questions and point you to primary sources- these are the places where the information was recorded for the first time. 

Asking professors for help is a great idea, but only once you have specific questions and can make sure you’re directing your questions to the right people. Generally we put a fair bit about what we do on the web, either through our university or personal websites. You can look at directories (For example [ directory of a department that actually does  X ]) and once you find someone whose expertise/ research area aligns with the question you’re asking- and then reach out to them- you might want to ask them specific questions about their opinions on things relevant to our area.

Good luck with your project!

Best,
Dr. Bahlai
