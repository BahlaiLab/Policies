# Policies

This repo contains a collection of policies, standard procedures and guidelines we adhere to in the Bahlai lab. These documents are intended to help lab members get aquainted with the culture of the lab, and to help collaborators and colleagues see how we do things. Generally, you'll probably want to read these in the following order:

1. [For prospective students](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/letter_to_prospective_student.md) So, you think you might want to be a computational ecologist. GREAT. Here's some stuff you need to think about before you sign up.
2. [General guidelines](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/general_guidelines.md) Wherein you can figure out the Bahlai Lab's general vibe.
3. [Code of conduct](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Code_of_conduct.md) Some ground rules for interacting in and with the lab.
4. [Consulting policy](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Consulting.md) You: "Nope, nope nope, I don't want to be in your lab, thanks. But I do need your help!"
5. [Tips for starting in the lab](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/tips_for_new_personnel.md) So you are here! Here's a Bahlai Lab quickstart guide.
6. [Oddly specific rules](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Oddly_specific_rules.md) Christie is a human being with pet peeves.
7. [Project completion guidelines](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Project_completion.md) You're here, you're doing stuff, but what does it look like to be PhDONE?
8. [Safety training and stuff](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies/blob/master/Bahlai%20Lab_Lab%20Specific%20Training.pdf) Docs for lab specific safety training etc.
