Hi Student!

Thank you for your interest in my lab. Our program is now closed to applications for the 2021-22 cohort year but will be accepting applications for 2022-23 in September-December. I was planning on taking one new student in 22-23. If you’re interested in working with me I encourage you to read some documents I’ve prepared about my lab culture and research interests.  The lab policies and procedures guide is here: 
https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies 

It contains information about my advising style, approaches and expectations.

I also expect incoming graduate students to have interest and familiarity in the work that is done in my lab (because presumably this is the type of work you want to learn to do!). Here’s my Google Scholar profile, be sure to sort by date as my more recent publications are the ones that are most relevant to what my group is working on right now:

Please let me know if you have trouble accessing any of the papers you're interested in reading.

For a glimpse into my most up-to-date research directions, you can peruse two recently funded grant proposals:

If you find you’re interested in pursuing a graduate program with me after looking at these materials, please drop me an email! I’m happy to set up a meeting to talk about our mutual interests, our program, and the application process.

My best,

Christie Bahlai
