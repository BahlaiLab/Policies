Hi Student!

Thank you for your interest in my lab. Our program is now closed to applications for the 2021-22 cohort year but will be accepting applications for 2022-23 in September-December of 2021. I was planning on taking one new MS or PhD student in 2022-23. If you’re interested in working with me I encourage you to read some documents I’ve prepared about my lab culture and research interests.  The lab policies and procedures guide is here: 
https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies 

This repository contains information about my advising style, approaches and expectations. All lab members are expected to adhere to the lab code of conduct.

I also expect incoming graduate students to have strong interest and familiarity in the work that is done in my lab (because presumably, this is the type of work you want to learn to do!). Here’s my Google Scholar profile, be sure to sort by date as my more recent publications are the ones that are most relevant to what my group is working on right now:

For a glimpse into my most up-to-date research directions, you can peruse two recently funded grant proposals:

If you’re interested in pursuing a graduate program with me after looking at these materials, please drop me an email detailing your background, research interests and career goals. If we find there are significant synergies between my research and your goals, I’m happy to set up a meeting to talk about our program and the application process.

My best,

Christie Bahlai
